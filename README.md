# Insulting!
The place to go when you need a new insult, for reasons.

## What?
An insult generator that fetches existing insults from a database, or builds new ones from parts, based on theme and severity.

## Why?
Because it's fun! It started out as a small .NET MVC project in late 2017, and has since been dormant on a forgotten drive.
Now I've decided to breathe new life into it, and rebuild it using other technologies, which simultaneoisly lets me try out some new stuff.

## How?
A backend API with Nodejs and Express, that hooks up to a mongoDB database, and a responsive web client with React that communicates with the API.
